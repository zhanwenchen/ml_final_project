The objective of the model is translating English sentences to French sentences. I am going to show the detailed steps, and they will answer to the questions like `how to preprocess the dataset`, `how to define inputs`, `how to define encoder model`, `how to define decoder model`, `how to build the entire seq2seq model`, `how to calculate the loss and clip gradients`, and `how to train and get prediction`.\n",

Let's go over eatch steps in the code cell below.\n",

Luckily, there is the official guide for this [TF Gradient Clipping How?](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/train#Gradient_Clipping). In breif, you get the gradient values from the optimizer manually by calling [compute_gradients](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Optimizer#compute_gradients), then manipulate the gradient values with [clip_by_value](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/clip_by_value).
